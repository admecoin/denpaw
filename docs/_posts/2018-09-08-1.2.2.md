- Changed the way to access multiple daemon configurations.
You can now send requests to different daemons with `playcoind()->client($name)` call. (e. g. `playcoind()->client('litecoin')->getBlock('...')`)
(see [Configuration](https://github.com/denpawmusic/laravel-playcoinrpc#configuration) and [Multiple Instances](https://github.com/denpawmusic/laravel-playcoinrpc#multiple-instances) for more info)
- Removed unused facade
